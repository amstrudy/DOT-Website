                <p  id = "secondpagep">The earth’s climate is the air, water and temperature conditions that it needs in order to support all the forms of life.  Climate change is the shift away from these ideal conditions.  It’s a bit like managing a terrarium, if you crank up the heat all the plants will die.  Climate change is believed to be caused by the release of greenhouse gases from cars and factories and deforestation among other things.  It’s a very real and present issue that will affect our futures drastically.   If we don’t make changes to our lifestyles now, we will pay for it later.</p>

                At our current carbon emissions, sea levels are expected to rise several feet within the next century.  This means that places close to sea level like Venice and Amsterdam  will sink into the ocean!  Where will these people go? The sea is also expected to warm as the general temperature of the earth increases.  This will make the ocean more acidic, killing millions of organisms and likely causing the extinction of many marine species. It won’t just be the polar bears, we’re talking about wholesale collapse of entire ecosystems!<br><br>
                But don’t lose hope!  There is plenty we can do to raise awareness and curb our own bad habits. Learn how you can help on the next page.

                Most scientists agree that climate change is caused by humans.  This is good because it means we have the power to stop it.  Not, “we” as in the general population, we’re talking about you, the person reading this on your computer or phone.<br><br>
                You only have to Do One Thing but you can do more!  The “Do One Thing” (DOT) initiative was created by the Alliance for Climate Education (ACE).  We want you to pledge to do one thing to fight climate change!  Whether it’s taking quicker showers or driving less you can make a difference.  You are the future of the world and by building good sustainable habits you can help save it.<br><br>
                On the next page is a list of DOTs that you can choose from.  If you want you can even make up your own!  Make sure to tell us your DOT so you can be a contributor to our school’s DOT mural.
